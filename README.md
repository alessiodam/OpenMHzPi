# OpenMHzPi

## What is OpenMHzPi and why?
OpenMHzPi is a program to listen to OpenMHz stations. I have always enjoyed listening to police radios, and a friend introduced me to [OpenMHz](https://openmhz.com/), which I instantly loved. I created this program to run on a Raspberry Pi 0 W2 to listen to my favorite stations.

## How to use OpenMHzPi (Linux)
1. Run the installer:
   ```bash
    sudo bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alessiodam/OpenMHzPi/master/install.sh)"
